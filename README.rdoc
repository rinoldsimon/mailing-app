== Send Email from ruby

Here I made an email set-up using ActionMailer

== Get repo
 git clone git@github.com:rinoldsimon/mailing-app.git
 cd mailing-app
 rails s
 
Visit localhost:3000 and create an user. Email will be generated and sent to user mail-id

== Note
 Dont forget to set your gmail id and password in config/environments/development.rb configuration file
